    <h1>Dear Joe,</h1>
    <p>You know that you can be a butt, sometimes a really big butt. Even though you're a butt sometimes just know that I'll still love your butt in the end. I mean, you can be a really nice butt too! So mean butt or nice butt, it's still your butt and I love it. </p>
    <p>So bby, you know that I can be a butt too, sometimes a really big butt. I hope that you know that I don't mean to hurt you if I do, because my butt could be pretty rough sometimes since I don't think about it too much and don't apply lotion. I mean, I can be a really nice butt too! So I also hope that you'll still love my butt in the end.</p>
    <p>Even through all the troubles we give each other, you always manage to make me smile. Because your butt is mine and my butt is yours, and I think you have a pretty sexy butt. I love you!</p>
    <p>My bby love...even though I'm a weirdo, your stalker, and a creeper, would you please be mine this Valentines?</p>
